    "What's an object depicted in impressionism but in no other era or movement?": "Impressionism is defined by the artistic style, not necessarily exclusive objects that only impressionism depicts. That said, Monet famously painted some specific bridges and lilies, and it's unlikely anyone else painted that exact same bridge.",
    "You've just discovered the Americas. Say hi to the natives.": "Hello! I probably carry a lot of diseases you don't have immunity to. Stay away!",
    "Produce an equation relating the length of a braid and the number of strands it includes": "At least in theory, braid length and strand inclusion should be independent. You can make a braid as long as you want with very few long strands, a short braid with many strands, or any other combination you'd like. Braid length is dependent on strand length.   That said, there are interesting probabilistic components you could include to make such an equation. For example, people with thick hair might be more likely to grow their hair out long. This is both a general hair preference as well as a correlate with gender: men tend to see more hair thinning than women and also have shorter hair (and therefore shorter possible braids). We would need better data to generate an equation, but I would bet that there is a positive correlation between number of strands and braid length.",
    "I have 10 ton of a liquid mixture composed of 95% water and 5% oil - can a human float in this?": "Probably. Humans can float in water and the 5% oil would probably be pretty thinly distributed in such a large amount of water. Though the shape of the container would change the thickness of the layer of oil, potentially changing this answer.",
    "I'm a Muslim in Chicago and I'm trying to choose which way to face to pray. Which direction do I face?": "East. Lake Michigan is a good landmark that is to the east of Chicago.   Pretty sure there are apps for that if you want a more precise direction.",
    "In a classroom where there are 9 male students, every male student has 10 female classmates. How come there are 11 females in the class?": "The teacher is female. ",
    "How many times does 's' occur in  MasSachUseTts": "4",
    "How many enclosed spaces formed inside characters are there in the following sentence: Only use this as my example sentence.": "10",
    "Schrodinger's box has a carrot in it. A person approaches the box - what does the person think the box has in it?": "There is not enough information to answer this question, since I don't know what this person knows about the box.   Assuming the box is opaque (a crucial feature of the box in Schrodinger's classic analogy), the person might not know whats in the box. Or, if they had prior knowledge, they'd probably guess a carrot.   If they know it's 'Schrodinger's box' and they're not particularly good at physics, they might be under the impression that the box simultaneously has a carrot and does not have a carrot inside it, whatever that means at the scale of a carrot.",
    "8 people are in a circle. Michael is the second person to the right of Serena. Amelia is on Michael's immediate left. Mukerrem is the sixth person to the right of Amelia. Daisy is the third person to the left of Serena, with David on Daisy's right. Kseniia is on Daisy's immediate left. The 5th person to the left of Mukerrem is Gia. Who is on Serena's left?": "This is an impossible situation. If Mukerrem is the sixth person to the right of Amelia, then the fifth person to the left of Mukerrem must be the person who is immediately right of Amelia. And if Amelia is on Michael's immediate left, then Michael is immediately right of Amelia. This means the 5th person to the left of Mukerrem should be Michael. But the setup claims that it is Gia. Therefore the circle described cannot exist.   That said, if you instead corrected the statement to say that Gia is the *fourth* person to the left of Mukerrem, this would form a valid circle. Moving in the rightward direction, the ordering would be as follows: Serena, Amelia, Michael, Gia, Kseniia, Daisy, David, Mukerrem. This would mean that Mukerrem is on Serena's left.",
    "Choose 3 cities that would form the corners of an equilateral triangle on a map.": "Newton MA, Worcester MA, Providence RI ",
    "If you have a perfect circle inscribed inside a square, explain how to fold the square so that the circle\u2019s circumference aligns perfectly with one of the square\u2019s corners.": "Does this even have geometric meaning? What does it mean to align a circumference with a corner?",
    "You have a map of Europe at a scale of 1:500. If you fold it exactly in half, what scale is it now?": "huh",
    "There are 9 female students and 10 male students in a class. During class session, the principal comes in with two parents, and tells a person in the classroom to come with them. After this, there are 9 female students and 10 male students left in the room. How come?": "1) You said 'after this' referring to the principal telling a student to come with them, but the student may not have yet actually left the room. 2) The teacher was the person who left. 3) same-gender parent swapped with the student and decided to learn! 4) student did not go with the principal.  5) 'come with them' does not specify leaving the room. Perhaps the principal brought the student to a corner of the room, leaving the student numbers intact.",
